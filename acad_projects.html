      I am currently learning how to visualize AI-based learning through Game Design tools such as Unreal Engine.
      This project is a simple demonstration of a 3D environment with a simple AI agent that learns to navigate
      through the environment. This project greatly furthered my understanding of AI and Game Design.

      As part of a team project, we created an online platform for users to plan their daily activities.
      The website uses APIs to calculate the best route for the user to take, and also provides a list of activities
      that the user can do at the destination. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

      As part of a team, I created an intuitive CLI-based application for assigning and reorganizing student groups
      into various orientation camps. Through this project, I delved into the various parts of the SDLC, and learnt
      how to code according to user requirements. The UML mockup from the SDLC has been shown above.
